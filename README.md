## Trip Planner

The Trip Planner Notebook generates two text files for flight and hotel quotes, and a client-focused dashboard.

### Flight Search with SkyScanner API

*What are the flight options available for the client's intended destination?*

> * A text file named `flights_output.txt` with detailed flight quote(s) information
> * A bar plot with price for any and all quotes retrieved by the API

### Hotel Search with Booking com API

*What is the hotel availability in the destination of interest?*

> * A scatter plot map with the number of hotels in a given city

![hotel locations](resources/exploration_cleanup_notebooks/flights_and_hotels/hotel_locations.png)

*What are some of the hotel options? How do these compare to each other in price and quality?*

> * A text file named `hotels_output.txt` with detailed information for 20 hotels in the area

> * A scatter plot of pricing vs. review scores for hotels in the location of choice

![hotel pricing](resources/exploration_cleanup_notebooks/flights_and_hotels/hotel_pricing.png)

### Folium Library

*How can we compare hotel locations with other points of reference?*
